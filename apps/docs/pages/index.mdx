# Welcome to Omni Stack

**Omni Stack** is a well design monorepo architecture which we can use to develop application,
using an intelligent build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases.

Our codebase's tasks - like `lint`, `build` and `test` - run as fast as it could, caching to turbocharge your local setup and speed up our CI.

# What's inside?

This is a monorepo template that uses `Yarn` as a package manager.
