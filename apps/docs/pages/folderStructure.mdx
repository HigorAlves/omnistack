All workspaces are defined by the top-level `package.json` file.

projects are used by nest commands like nest build and nest start when a project name is not supplied.

## Understanding the monorepo

First, open `./packages/ui/package.json`. You'll notice that the package's name is `"name": "ui"` - right at the top of the file.

Next, open `./apps/web/package.json`. You'll notice that this package's name is `"name": "web"`. But also - take a look in its dependencies.

You'll see that "web" depends on a package called "ui".

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ui": "*"
  }
}
```

This means that our **`web` app depends on our local `ui` package**.

If you look inside `apps/docs/package.json`, you'll see the same thing. Both `web` and `docs` depend on `ui` - a shared component library.

This pattern of sharing code across applications is extremely common in monorepos - and means that multiple apps can share a single design system.

## Understanding imports and exports

Take a look inside `./apps/docs/pages/index.tsx`. Both docs and web are Next.js applications, and they both use the ui library in a similar way:

```javascript
import { Button } from "ui";
//       ^^^^^^         ^^

export default function Docs() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Docs</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

They're importing `Button` directly from a dependency called `ui`! How does that work? Where is `Button` coming from?

Open `packages/ui/package.json`. You'll notice these two attributes:

```json
{
  "main": "./index.tsx",
  "types": "./index.tsx"
}
```

When workspaces import from ui, main tells them where to access the code they're importing. Type tells them where the
TypeScript types are located.

## Understanding `tsconfig`

We have two more workspaces to look at, `tsconfig` and `eslint-config-custom`. Each of these allow for shared
configuration across the monorepo. Let's look in `tsconfig`:

```json
{
  "name": "tsconfig",
  "files": ["base.json", "nextjs.json", "react-library.json"]
}
```

Here, we specify three files to be exported, inside files. Packages which depend on tsconfig can then import them directly.

## Understanding `eslint-config-custom`

You'll notice that this is named slightly differently to the other workspaces. It's not as concise as ui or tsconfig.
Let's take a look inside `.eslintrc.js` in the root of themonorepo to figure out why.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // This tells ESLint to load the config from the workspace `eslint-config-custom`
  extends: ["custom"],
};
```

ESLint resolves configuration files by looking for workspaces with the name `eslint-config-*`. This lets us write
extends: `['custom']` and have ESLint find our local workspace.

But why is this in the root of the monorepo?

The way ESLint finds its configuration file is by looking at the closest `.eslintrc.js`. If it can't find one in the current directory,
it'll look in the directory above until it finds one.

So that means that if we're working on code inside `packages/ui` (which doesn't have a `.eslintrc.js`) it'll refer to the root instead.

Apps that do have an `.eslintrc.js` can refer to custom in the same way. For instance, in docs:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ["custom"],
};
```

Just like `tsconfig`, `eslint-config-custom` lets us share ESLint configs across our entire monorepo, keeping things
consistent no matter what project you're working on.

## Understanding `apps`

Aside from compile and build considerations, an application-type project within a workspace is functionally identical
to an application within a standard mode structure.
Here we define our core applications,that consumes our other packages inside the workspace and external packages, we use this folder,
mainly to develop the core features that every `stack` will use.

## Understanding `libs`

A library is a way of packaging a general purpose set of features that can be used within other projects. A library cannot run on its own.
It's a bunch of low level tools that we can use to help our other `workspaces`.

\*\* A `lib` cant depend on any other `workspace`

> You can think on a lib as a `util` folder where we have code to help us.

## Understanding `packages`

You can think on `packages` as the name suggest we use this folder to create abstractions or implementations to use inside our
core `apps`, by example we can have a package called `database` that creates ways to interact with `dynamoDB` or `mongoDB`,
and our `apps` our `stacks` can make use of these packages.

> Packages can use `libs` but `libs` cannot use `packages` as it dependencies

## Understanding `scripts`

Low level tools used to handle CI/CD process or helping developers.

## Understanding `services`

Services a used mainly for data ingestion, transformation and consume outside services, so we can use it and
handle there results turning it easy to use in our `apps` or `stacks`, less dependent from another `workspaces` better.

## Understanding `stacks`

Here were we define our specific platform configurations for each client, we use this to build their personalized platform.

## Understanding `turbo.json`

We now understand our repository and its dependencies. How does Turborepo help?

Turborepo helps by making running tasks simpler and much more efficient.

Let's take a look inside turbo.json, at the root:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      //   ^^^^^
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "lint": {},
    "dev": {
      //   ^^^
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

What we're seeing here is that we've registered three tasks with turbo - `lint`, `dev` and `build`.
Every task that's registered inside `turbo.json` can be run with `turbo run <task>` (or `turbo <task> for short`).
To see this in action, let's try running a script called `hello` - which doesn't yet exist in our `turbo.json`:

```bash
turbo hello
```

You'll see this error in the console:

```bash
task `hello` not found in turbo `pipeline` in "turbo.json".
Are you sure you added it?
```

That's worth remembering - in order for turbo to run a task, it must be in `turbo.json`.
Let's investigate the scripts we already have in place.
